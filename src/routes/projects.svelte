<p>Component where I've worked before</p>

	These are some projects I have worked on outside work, sourced from my <a
		href="https://github.com/floriankuc"
		target="_blank"
	>
		Github profile
	</a>
	and generally work in progress. Some on the verge of completion, others I may have abandoned entirely
	in the light of something more captivating. ðŸ˜‡

<ul>
