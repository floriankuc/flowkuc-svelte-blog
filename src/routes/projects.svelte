  These are some projects I have worked on outside work, sourced from
  my <a href="https://api.github.com/users/floriankuc" target="_blank">
    Github profile
  </a>
  and generally work in progress. Some on the verge of
  completion, others I may have abandoned entirely in the light of
  something more captivating. ðŸ˜‡
